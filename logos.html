								This is a profile picture logo made for an Instagram account related to a game called 
                                Animal Crossing. I (the owner) wanted it to have the name of the Instagram account with 
                                extra things that are related to a jungle. The heart added in the back was a little touch 
                                I added to show the love that is spread through this account. Since the island was created
                                around the movie Jumanji I wanted to keep that in mind when I was creating it. In addition, 
                                the colours were chosen carefully like the blue to represent the water.

								For my UX Design Thinking class we were tasked with creating a logo 
								and name for our group project. My group decided on the name "The 4 
								Elements" and this is the logo I created. We decided on The 4 Elements 
								because we are all different but we are bringing our own ideas to this 
								group project to come together.

								In high school we were tasked with creating a mock up restaurant website. For this restaurant we had to created
								a floor plan of the store, the outside of the store, a menu, logo, and name. I decided to create United Cafe as my 
								mock design. This was one of the first things I ever designed and was one of the reasons why I decided to go to 
								school for designing as this was my favourite project. Looking back on this project after 5 years there are many 
								things that I could do better with the experience I have now.

								This logo was an updated logo for the website Jessie's Teaching Corner. 
								This website was created to help new teachers with different lesson plans
								and information. The original logo was just a plan J with nothing special 
								about it. The owner wanted something that represented both teaching and 
								herself. The J was for herself and the apple was to represent teachers.

                            An important part of designing is to ensure that the design is 
							visually accessible. You want to ensure that you are able to see 
							what the image is meant to be and effectively communicate through 
							design. Something that is visually accessible “refers to the 
							clarity of the images, text and other design elements” (Cornish 
							et al. 178). When designing the design must be inclusive and is 
							directed at their specific target audiences. In addition, there 
							are also different design recommendations for people with cognitive 
							disabilities. It is important to design products that are available 
							for everyone.
                        </p>
                        <p>
							The reason I mentioned the visually accessible design logos is 
							because our society needs to become more accessible for everyone. 
							For my logos, making them minimal and easily describable adds to 
							making them visually accessible. It is important to focus on future 
							designs to ensure that they are inclusive and visually accessible for 
							everyone who will be interacting with it.
