                                The product we created was the colour box
                                that can help people learn and design with
                                different colours. We wanted a place for
                                many colours to be in the same place at once
                                where you can physically see the colour
                                you are picking. After having to change our
                                initial design ideas we finally came up with
                                a product that is both useful and a learning
                                tool. My group members and I cannot wait and
                                see how this product progresses in the future.

                                The colour box is a way for people to learn and
                                use colours in a more interactive way. Designers
                                will be able to pick out their colours before
                                designing and people who are learning colours have
                                a hand on experience with the actual colours. We
                                wanted to make something that shows what all the
                                colours look like after printed out since different
                                colours look differently in different lighting.
                                Saves an extra step in the design process,
                                you do not want to print everything out and then
                                change your mind.

                                    After we came up with our idea, we had to begin 
                                    some basic research. We wanted to figure out 
                                    which colours were most used in learning and 
                                    designing. After the research we decided on having 
                                    the main colours of the rainbow plus the most used 
                                    shades in-between. We ended up picking just over 
                                    130 different colours for the box which we formatted 
                                    in a word document which we printed out. After it was 
                                    printed out, we wanted to make the cards durable so 
                                    they will last longer. For this we used cardboard so 
                                    the cards can be easily gripped and moved around. 
                                    
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Moving onto the box design we wanted to have everything 
                                    enclosed in a larger box with smaller boxes on the inside. 
                                    We found a box that was a perfect size (10 in x 12 in x 7 in) 
                                    and then did some measurements to figure out how many 
                                    compartments we could have inside. We ended up being able to 
                                    have 12 boxes inside which were all made from hot glue, 
                                    cardboard, and paper. After everything was put together, 
                                    we combined everything and our project became a useable prototype.

                                In the end we were all happy with what
                                we created and proud of what we can accomplish
                                when we put our minds together. After this
                                project we learned what its like to work
                                collaboratively in a group starting with an idea
                                and moving towards a product. If we were to continue
                                with this product, I would like to make it out of
                                better materials to ensure that the product will last
                                after being handled a lot. I would also want to conduct
                                some research to see what colours are used more
                                frequently in design so we can expand our colour
                                selection. This project opened my mind about the
                                possibilities that UX involves and how maybe one day
                                I will be a product designer.

                            In a classroom setting “imaginative and divergent
                            thinking practices... are seen to build student
                            critical thinking skills while developing personality
                            and dispositional traits such as persistence and a
                            critical eye” (McGlashan 2). The colour box is a great
                            way to allow users to be creative and gain their own
                            critical thinking independence while exploring different
                            colours in the box. Receiving these hands-on practices
                            also feeds into a person’s tinkering skills. According
                            to Michael Morgan, when users are tinkering “we can
                            realize what were previously unseen possibilities” (Morgan 3).
                            When people are allowed to tinker and work with objects
                            they can explore and figure out what works best with one another.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The reason I mentioned designing in classrooms is because it is
                            important to teach people about the true colours. In today’s
                            society learning about true colours is important as the colours
                            on a digital screen can be different than when it is printed out.
                            In addition, using tinkering skills are great way to learn and
                            explore to figure what works best with one another. By allowing
                            people to tinker with colours they are able to design and learn
                            easier.
