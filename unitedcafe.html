                                I was tasked with an assignment to create, design,
                                and deliver a website for a made up website. For the
                                assignment we did research on what made a good website
                                and what made a good cafe. With this information we
                                then had to create a website that is user friendly and
                                easy to navigate.

                                    After some research I found somethings that
                                    I wanted to add into my website. Some factors
                                    that make a cafe website better. Some websites
                                    I have came across have not had hours of
                                    operations or a very difficult to navigate menu.
                                    When I was planing it out I wanted to ensure that
                                    things were easy to navigate and easy to find.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Over the course of this project I made a few
                                    different sketches and notes about what my plans
                                    were. I had different notes for the logo, menu
                                    ideas, and things I definitely wanted to add.
                                    Unfortunately this was the only sketch I was
                                    able to find from my research.

                                United Café was created for the entire family which means it has to be designed for 
                                the entire family. From those who have perfect health to those who are older and 
                                anyone who has any disabilities, we want to make sure there is room for all. Many 
                                older customers or people with visual impartments may have troubles reading a menu 
                                so we want to ensure that the menu is designed with care. On top of the visual design, 
                                we want to make sure that the restaurant would also be accessible. This includes 
                                dietary meal options along with accessible washrooms and tables that have room for 
                                wheelchairs. Designing for the whole family is what will help bring everyone together. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Designing is an important part of a business, if it doesn’t work for one person in 
                                the family, they will be unable to go there. Rather than focusing on the typical 
                                person we have to expect the unexpected. This is why I mentioned the older generations 
                                and the people that may have disabilities. Making things inclusive will bring more 
                                people into the café because designing for a family brings families closer.
